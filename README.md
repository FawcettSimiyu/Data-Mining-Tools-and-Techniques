**Need assistance with your Data Mining assignment?**  
I’m here to guide you through analyzing datasets and formulating insightful data mining questions to derive meaningful insights. Together, we’ll explore global energy consumption and population statistics using statistical analysis tools like R or Python.

---

### ✅ **What You’ll Get**

#### **1. Data Set Overview**

We’ll be working with two datasets:

1. **Data Set 1A: Global Energy Consumption (1800-2021)**
   - This dataset provides the global energy consumption in terawatts, categorized by energy source for each year from 1800 to 2021.
   
2. **Data Set 1B: Population Statistics (1960-2021)**
   - This dataset tracks the population changes for various countries from 1960 to 2021.

These datasets contain important temporal and demographic information, which we will analyze to derive insights about global energy trends and population growth.

#### **2. Tasks Breakdown**

##### **Part 1: Data Set Exploration and Formulation of Data Mining Questions**

**A) Data Types**  
- **Global Energy Consumption (1A):**  
  This dataset is a **temporal** dataset, as it tracks energy consumption across years. It's **time-series** data since it captures energy usage over time (years).
  
- **Population Statistics (1B):**  
  This dataset is also **temporal** as it tracks population growth over time. It is **time-series** data, detailing changes in population over the years.

**B) Formulating Data Mining Questions**  
- **Global Energy Consumption (1A):**  
  **Question:** What is the relationship between the consumption of renewable energy sources (wind, solar, hydro) and fossil fuel consumption over the years?  
  This question helps explore how renewable energy sources have been displacing or complementing fossil fuels.

- **Population Statistics (1B):**  
  **Question:** What is the correlation between population growth and energy consumption in major industrialized countries?  
  This question would help assess whether population increases are directly related to increased energy consumption.

**C) Preprocessing for Comparison**  
To compare the **Global Energy Consumption** with **Population Statistics**, we need to preprocess the data by:
1. **Aligning the time period:** Ensure that both datasets have matching years, as one dataset starts in 1800 (Energy) while the other starts in 1960 (Population).
2. **Normalization:** Scale both datasets to a common unit, as global energy consumption is given in terawatts and population statistics in absolute figures.
3. **Handling missing data:** Fill missing values using interpolation or remove rows with missing data to maintain consistency.
4. **Data transformation:** Aggregate both datasets to the same granularity (e.g., yearly data) to ensure comparability.

**D) Stakeholders and Use Cases**  
Stakeholders interested in this merged dataset could include:
- **Government Agencies:** Use this data to predict future energy demands based on population trends and plan for sustainable energy generation.
- **Energy Companies:** Help energy companies forecast energy consumption and plan for infrastructure investments based on projected population growth and historical energy trends.
- **Environmental NGOs:** Use the data to assess the environmental impact of increasing energy consumption relative to population growth and promote cleaner energy policies.

**E) Additional Data Mining Questions with New Data**  
If we had access to additional data, the following questions could be explored:
1. **Climate Change Data (e.g., temperature trends):**  
   **Question:** How does the rate of global temperature increase correlate with energy consumption trends and population growth?  
   Additional data from climate databases could help explore the impact of rising energy consumption on global warming.
   
2. **Technological Advancements Data (e.g., adoption of renewable energy technologies):**  
   **Question:** How has the adoption of renewable energy technologies (e.g., solar panels, wind turbines) influenced energy consumption patterns over time?  
   This would require data on technology adoption rates to understand their impact on energy consumption.
   
3. **Economic Indicators (e.g., GDP growth):**  
   **Question:** How does economic growth (GDP) influence energy consumption and population growth in developing versus developed countries?  
   We could use economic data to analyze the relationship between economic development and energy needs.

#### **3. Code Implementation**

For part 2 of the assignment, we will write a Python program (or R notebook) to:
- **Load the datasets** and perform necessary **data cleaning** (e.g., handling missing values, normalization).
- **Statistical Analysis**: We will calculate key statistical measures such as mean, median, standard deviation, and correlations between energy consumption and population data.
- **Visualization**: Using Python libraries (matplotlib, seaborn) or R packages (ggplot2) to create visualizations like scatter plots, line graphs, and histograms to help interpret the data.
